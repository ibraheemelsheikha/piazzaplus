This is not a reasonable time for the difficulty and length of the questions presented. The problem statements for each question were painfully long to read and confusing in a stress filled environment. Also, there's absolutely no way those questions were to take 10-15 minutes to complete, for slow readers like me it was a challenge to keep track of some questions. I did most past exams, all the textbook questions and previous labs - the difficulty of the questions presented in this particular exam was much much higher compared to that. I would like to suggest that despite the lectures and textbook problems being helpful to learn the content, for today's exam it was not very useful for most of the questions. It feels like all the effort was pretty much useless, the one benefit was that one question was identical from one of the past exams.

Question 29 simply wants to you to look at the code and see that it is returning a pointer to a local variable which is used later on, causing undefined behavior I noticed some students were actually instead running the code. Question 27 simply needs you to remove that extra semicolon. For question 28 you\u2019d have to move the i++ outside of the body of the if statement. In my opinion, these are all questions that can be answered very quickly. Glimpsing at what some students were doing, some were even testing some true/false or MCQ questions with code, which is, in my opinion, a poor time management strategy.

Not even kidding, the persons computer beside me shut off for 10 minutes of the exam, how is that even fair? imagine someone taking your paper from you on a calc exam for 10 minutes and you just have to sit there and watch everyone else write.

I would be worried if someone doesn't know how to use VS code. For students who had a computer crash were given extra time to cover for the time lost. The IT team is working on ensuring this doesn't happen at all to anyone. I fully understand the stress that comes with technical issues during the exam, but I taught students who did programming exams on paper and on computers. I can confidently say that computer-based exams is pushing students to practice more and efficiently before the exam than paper based exams. I have seen people change their studying habits just because the exam is computer-based. Since the exam is more aligned with what happens in writing your lab assignments than papers, students are more inclined to complete the lab assignments themselves rather than using GenAI tools. We are in a new era. Instead of moving backwards and taking exams on paper, I prefer if we current fix issues with computer-based exams. I am eager to know more about your experiences and will send out a survey soon about it."

This wasted a lot of time that I could\u2019ve spent thinking about the actual problems. Besides the issues with VS code, the problems were also very long and too complex. Also in comparison to the midterm, which was 1 hour and 50 minutes long for 24 questions, the final was 2 hours and 30 minutes for 38 questions. Considering there were 14 more questions and only forty more minutes, and given difficulty level of the coding questions and issues with VS code, I personally feel that the exam was not a fair assessment. I understand that the second half of the course is much more difficult than the first half, but with such major differences between the two halves of the course, I wish there were more practice questions that reflected this level of difficulty.

    "instructor_answer": "I have read all comments carefully and reflected on what happened. I am writing this after I have submitted final marks. Last year's course average is 74, and this year it is 76. Regarding the compiler, for many of the errors I saw during the exam itself, it was mainly due to running into an infinite loop, probably because of the question on removing spaces from a string. The execution wasn't complete or \"Permission denied\" or other similar errors were either because there is a compile-time error or because there is a running task from a program having an infinite loop or that didn't exit as it was left hanging waiting for an input. This is why many students had to close VS code and reopen it every time before running a new program. I understand that I haven't seen all errors myself, so there might be other issues. However, I doubt it is a compiler or VS Code issue since these errors didn't happen to everyone. I am not blaming anyone. I am only noting that there might be something you were not aware of how to deal with since the exam environment is new. Regarding the time allocated for the exam, I agree the exam was long compared to the midterm. To be transparent, the midterm was quite short given you were having the aid of a computer, so we were inclined to create a longer final exam. Compared to the midterm, the 14 additional questions were predominantly on the easier side of the exam. To be specific, we had 5 more T/F, 5 more MCQs, 3 more short answer/debugging questions and only 2 more programming questions. I personally felt it was quite fair given that most of the additional questions were relatively easy. However, maybe what we didn't consider much was that additional questions require more reading and understanding before answering, even if they were easy. Also to be fair in my assessment,\u00a0I have to say that the 2-3 programming questions were way more challenging that previous years final exams, and that was with the intention to challenge those who got full marks in the midterm -- who were many. But also there were questions for everyone (easy, medium, challenging and very challenging). In the end, I took everyone's comments into consideration. The grading was lenient and we did curve the final exam. I can't make anymore comments yet. However, I will make a Quercus announcement about details when I am allowed to do so (after the grades gets approved)."

Next time you see a question, start by asking yourself how many loops do I need and what should they do? Also, can I eliminate a loop by using a string functions I know? Another example, linked lists require having a current pointer to loop over nodes. If the question is about insertion, for example, you need to know the address of the node after which you will insert the node. Ask yourself the 4 top most special cases in linked lists: what happens when the list is empty? When we insert at tail? When we insert at front? What happens if we have one node?

The only constraints are that you cannot convert between \"floating type\" and \"pointer type\", and vice versa (section 6.5.5). Only when dereferencing it could we get undefined behavior.\n> Among the invalid values for dereferencing a pointer \\[...\\] are an address inappropriately aligned for the type of object pointed to.\u201d (section 6.5.4.4). \n\nAll that to say that C does allow you to assign double pointers to int addresses, even though it's not good practice and you shouldn't do it in your code.\n\n### For option 3:\nThis is a little trickier. The ISO says:\n> Any pointer type may be converted to an integer type. The result is implementation-defined. If the result cannot be represented in the integer type, the behavior is undefined.\n\nSo it is undefined behavior to assign an integer type to a pointer type.

    "instructor_answer": "Practice mainly on the past final exams - the questions on this years exam will be similar in content and difficulty. If you\u2019re someone who gets stressed and your performance tanks under pressure, try to simulate that stressful environment and do a few mock exams to get yourself more comfortable with that setting. Eg. go to a library/study room, set a timer and strictly enforce not checking the solution until you\u2019re done the exam. Time management is extremely important on the exam. Just like in the midterm, you will probably be able to solve most problems given enough time. But can you do it fast enough? Most students (from past offerings and present) report that the exams in this course are fair but very long. So you need to learn to spend the right amount of time on each question, and learn to move on when you\u2019ve spent too much time on one question. One trick I find useful is this: when you open the exam, read the last few programming questions first and start thinking about it in the background while you do the easy problems. And of course, practice will help you do everything faster. Definitely spend some time thinking about common idioms of working with linked lists (eg. insertion, deletion, traversal), and memorize them if you have to, so that it becomes second nature to you. Let me know if you have any other questions."

It is true that the problems we give you tend to be simple 'toy' examples, and for many of these you can easily find a non-recursive solution.\u00a0 But there are many problems where defining recurrences is key to solving them efficiently, for instance anything under the category of Dynamic Programming ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming) .\u00a0 Trying to solve a dynamic programming problem without a recurrence blows up in runtime, while it remains tractable with a recurrence, and if the subproblems are sparse then a non-recursive solution will waste a lot of work, assuming that a non-recursive solution is even possible. I will also point out that for the simple problems with just one recursive call that we've given you, the tail recursion optimization ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail-recursion) means that they don't actually take up any more stack space than an iterative approach. Bloggers love to talk down to people, but it's best not to take them too seriously.\u00a0 Every technique has its uses, even if we aren't giving you the difficult problems that need them."

They are used to list function prototypes. \n\nWhen you do #include \"lab8part1.h\", the first step the compiler will do is replace this line with the contents of the file. This means your file has the function prototypes, but not the implementations. Your job is now to implement those functions.\n\nThis is our way of forcing you to use the functions we described. If someone chooses not to do so, it's not a big deal in part 1. For part 2, it is an issue as we will compile your code with our own main function, and our own main function expects that you have implemented the functions in the header file.\n\nHope this helps!"

    "instructor_answer": "The reason for dynamic memory allocation is flexibility (to allocate and deallocate whenever you want in your program). One benefit out of this is to use memory efficiently. \n\nThere is nothing that prevents you from dynamically allocating space for a single variable. For example, we can dynamically allocate a single double using\n\n`double* ptrToDouble = malloc(sizeof(double) * 1);`\n\nBut here you have the pointer stored on the stack with size 8 bytes and the double itself on the heap with another 8 bytes. This is versus having only a double variable on the stack: `double y;` In terms of space, dynamically allocating one variable is not worth it.\n\n>Isn't it possible for those to make us run out of space and make the program crash? So what \"preventative methods\" do we have for those other data types?\n\nIf you as a programmer know that your program is memory heavy, you can in fact compile your program and set a requirement for the stack/heap size. If you don't want to do so, then you have to be critical of the amount of memory you use by being efficient. \n\nWe don't get into efficient coding in APS105. We slightly touch on it in ECE 244 and delve deeper in ECE 345. The main objective as you prototype and draft code is to make it work (100% functional), then you start thinking about memory/space and time efficiency."

    "content": "Dear, APS105 instructors,\n\nIt has been many sleepless nights of testing my code. The dread began to set as I debugged my code to amend all of the logical flaws of my program, I was losing sight of my goals and myself. However, as I played with my now fixed code and used all of the test inputs, to my surprise, they seem to match the given expected output. \n\nI, a little naive APS105 programmer student, was brimming with hope and joy but alas, I have yet to pass a single test case. This letter so dearly written to the APS105 team is no mere inquiry but rather a call for distress. As I waste away in the endless loop of testing cases and reading through my program, there lies an infinitesimally small shard of hope to hear your response.

I did have a comeback in my second midterm as an undergraduate where I got the highest mark. What did I do differently? I spoke with my instructor, and she told me that practice makes perfect. Lab assignments are not enough, and you have to look at many practice problems to get it. I was discouraged initially when I look at a problem and I struggle doing it. I realized struggling and making mistakes is part of the learning process. You won\u2019t get better by looking at someone\u2019s code or by reading notes. I used to play basketball, so I will use this analogy. I didn\u2019t get better at basketball by watching the NBA. I got better by playing more in the field. It took time and effort, but results are guaranteed. Feel free to come and see me! I am willing to give more advice and maybe follow up with you every week if you want :)",
    "endorsed_answer": "As someone who struggled to learn coding before, I found it very difficult starting out, but I learned certain techniques and ways of practicing that really helped. Here is some advice I have overall and for the course: For learning: I found it really helpful to understand not only what code does, but why it is used and its purpose. For example, why do we use a do while loop vs. a while loop. This will help in problem solving as you can recognize which \"tools\" you may use in your program. The course textbook is really useful to read and well-written. There are quizzes and exercises in each chapter that were good practice. When looking at coding examples, break down their solution and ask yourself why each line is important. Maybe print it out and write comments as well as trace it to understand what is happening. For labs/problem solving: If you find you are working on a problem for too long, step back and take a break to think it over. Instead, maybe think about the problem on your walk to class or when you're not at the computer screen. This may sound crazy, but a lot of the times I think of solutions while I'm trying to fall asleep, so I keep a notepad nearby to write it down and try it out later. Try approaching the problem without thinking of code first and write down the logical steps you would do as comments in your c program. Then for each comment you write think of a way to replace it with code and tackle it in steps by thinking what \"tool\" can you use. It is easy to fall into the trap of trying to code first and feeling frustrated because there is no direction. For examinations: While learning and labs should prepare you well for the exams, I do have some tips that may help Obviously, doing past examinations are very important, but try to find patterns of certain types of questions and relate them to concepts. This way you can profile these questions and have an idea of where to start. The past midterms showed themes of: Conditional statements: compare values and print something out based on it (usually with if, else if, and else statements) Modulus operator and integer division: use to get digits of an integer number and then do something with it, finding divisors Nested loops: star printing questions Arrays: iterate through array and read values of array to do something like finding the largest number Time management: Its pressuring to see a clock counting down and you're not thinking fast enough. When doing midterm problems, time yourself but don't look at the clock until you finish. I found that this gave me an internal clock to know when I should move on to the next question and comeback without feeling pressured. It also made me trust myself more with time management as sometimes when looking at the clock once you're done, you spent less time than expected. Closer to the exam date you can look at the clock while doing practice problems to simulate the actual exam. You can also scroll through the exam and look at the problem solving questions so while you're doing the multiple choice, you start thinking about it before you face it. You can also allocate how much time you should use on each question. (for multiple choice maybe max 20 min and the last question, usually the hardest will be 20 min, this is up to how well you know your abilities and certain questions you are good at) Learning how to code is difficult. I remember spending countless hours trying to do assignments and memorizing solutions to problems in hopes of succeeding. Although, from my experience practice for me is less about solving or knowing how to do problems, but more about learning \"tools\" and patterns that I know when to apply. Before I would try to do every single question for practice (which is good, but takes a lot of time); however, after a while you start to see patterns where solutions click easily. In simple words, you learn what some code does, but you need to learn when you use it. I hope that my advice helps, reading your post took me back to when I first started coding and felt like it was impossible to improve. Don't give up and continue to work hard!"

If there are multiple steps to reach the final answer, you are getting partial marks on each step you take. It doesn't matter what approach you are taking as long as the logic in the step is right. \n\nIn programming, the same happens. For example, you are asked to write a program that asks the user to take input integers from the user till they enter a 0 and print their sum. Say that question is worth 9 marks. 3 marks will be on if you are taking input from the user, 3 marks on if your program stops as the user enters 0, 3 marks on calculating and printing correctly. These marks are not binary too. You can get partial credit per each step. For example, if you didn't take input from the user fully correctly, you might get 1/3 or 2/3 depending on how many mistakes you made in the step."

For example in my conversation pasted below, the textbook doesn't explicitly explain that, so I can't double check. Below is a snapshot from Snefru chatbox of my conversation. _________________________ when we add 1 to an address is it really just adding 1 or is it adding 1*sizeof(data type)? When you add 1 to a pointer address in C, it actually adds 1 * sizeof(data_type} . This means the pointer arithmetic takes into account the size of the data type that the pointer is pointing to. For example, if you have an int pointer and you add 1 to it, it will move the pointer by the size of an integer (typically 4 bytes on many systems). Read more in: Chapter 08 - Dynamic-memory-allocation: Exercises what about minusing two pointers? what does this reveal about pointer arithmetic ? When you subtract two pointers in C, the result is the number of elements of the data type between the two pointers, not the number of bytes. This means that the subtraction operation returns the difference in terms of the number of elements pointed to, taking into account the size of the data type. For example, if you have two int pointers, ptr1 and ptr2 , and you perform the operation ptr1 - ptr2 , the result will be an integer representing how many int elements are between the two pointers. The arithmetic is performed in terms of the base type size, so the result will be unit-less\u2014in terms of how many elements are between them. followupNew Question",

So a PRNG like rand() will always produce the same sequence of numbers if you give it the same seed.\u00a0 It's not actually random, but it is pseudorandom, which means that it's hard to predict what sequence of numbers it will produce for a given seed without just running it.\u00a0 Note that the default rand() isn't good enough at being random for cryptography, but you don't need to think about that right now.

When things don't work, use the debugger as outlined in lab 0, and as we will discuss in the next plenary lecture as well. \n\nDon't wait to the last minute. Attend the lab sessions and seek help from TAs. They will help out. Office hours are also available.  \n\nNever copy code.

    "instructor_answer": "Calling a method isn't the same as a function prototype. A function prototype is closer to creating a method. In both C and Java you can call functions (a method is basically a function). In Java, when you _define_ (create) a method, you're also declaring it. From what I remember with Java, you can't just declare a method. If you want to be specific, you're declaring and defining a method at the same time. (A method is basically a function, but has a hidden argument for the object). Also, you can overload methods in Java, so methods with different arguments can have the same name. In C, you cannot overload functions. A \"declaration\" in C, would just be declaring that there is a function with a name. You could do `int foo();`, that declares a function called foo, but doesn't tell you anything about the arguments. A prototype includes all arguments as well, so `int foo(int, int);` would be a prototype. All declarations are prototypes, but not all prototypes are declarations. Let me know if that makes sense.

For rounding, does the format specifier \" %.2\" round the doubles or does it just cut off all the digits after the second decimal point?

I would like some clarification if I used the correct format specifier with the example below: The price for the order should be (unrounded): $$1.5 * 3 * 1.13 = 5.0850$$. Since the digit following the \" 5 \" in the thousandths place is a 0 (5.08 5 0 ), the number should round down.

Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are). Edit questions and answers wiki-style. Think of Piazza as a Q&A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single students' answer that students can edit collectively (and a single instructors\u2019 answer for instructors). Add a followup to comment or ask further questions. To comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a followup discussion . Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&A above. Go anonymous. Shy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously. Tag your posts. It's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a \u201c#\u201d before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag. Format code and equations. Adding a code snippet? Click the pre or tt button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text. \nMathematical equation? Click the Fx button to access the LaTeX editor to build a nicely formatted equation. View and download class details and resources.
